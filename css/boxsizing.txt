box-sizing: content-box | border-box | padding-box //default is content-box

if we set the width of 100px to an element then by default only the width of the content will be 100px.
inaddition there will be padding and border which will make the calculation bit tough.

box-sizing: border-box  - this makes the width of the content to include content, padding, border.
