Flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension. Either Row or Column.

display: flex;
flex-direction: row | column | row-reverse | column-reverse (default is row)
justify-content: center | space-between | space-around | flex-start | flex-end | space-evenly
align-items: center | flex-start | flex-end | stretch
flex-wrap: wrap | nowrap | wrap-reverse (default is no-wrap)
align-content: center | flex-start | flex-end | space-between | space-around | space-evenly
gap: row-gap | column-gap


justify-content: one which aligns across the main axis
align-items: one which aligns across the perpendicular to the main axis
flex-wrap: wraps the flex items to the next line if overflows

for Flex items:
    order - order in which the items should be displayed
    flex-grow - the rate in which the item should fill the remaining space
    flex-shrink - the rate in which the item should wrap
    flex-basis - the base width of the item.
    flex: flex-grow | flex-shrink | flex-basis
    align-self: flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch
