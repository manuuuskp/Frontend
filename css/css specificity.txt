understanding specificity is important.
specifity determines which style will be applied to which element.

!important - takes more specificity than all.

inherited - takes the lowest precendence as the style is applied to its parent not to it.
* - universal selector takes the lowest precendence.
element - higher specificity than universal and inherited.
attribute - higher than element.
class - higher than attribute.
id - higher than class.

combined selectors - takes specificity combined.
<style><style> - takes specificity higher than css stylesheets if same css selector is used.
style="" directly in html - takes more precedence of all.
