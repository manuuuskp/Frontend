Implement a member function called findMiddleNode() that finds and returns the middle node of the linked list.
Note: this LinkedList implementation does not have a length member variable.

Output:
Return the middle node of the linked list.
If the list has an even number of nodes, return the second middle node (the one closer to the end).


Constraints:
You are not allowed to use any additional data structures (such as arrays) or modify the existing data structure.
You can only traverse the linked list once.

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
output - 4

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]


findMiddleNode() {
    
}
