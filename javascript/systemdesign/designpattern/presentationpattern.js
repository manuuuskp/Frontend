// presentation container pattern is used for seperation of concerns.
// basically in react fetching the API and maintaining the state logic happens in one component and rendering the actual component as a seperate one
// which is stateless.
// This type is called Container/presentational Pattern.

// now a days after the introduction of hooks this pattern becomes less usable as hooks do all the state logic and fetching logic.
