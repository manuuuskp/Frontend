// this is the ES6 modules.
// We can seperate functions into seperate the modules thus reducing the size of the file as well.
// This will also avoid polluting the global objects and also acts as an encapsulation.

// we can export whatever is necessary.
// we can also import dynamically.

// (async function() {
//     const res = await import('./../something.js');
//     console.log(res.default);
// })()
