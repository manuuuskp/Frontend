before the introduction of promises.

callbacks were used.

Callbacks are the reason for the asynchronous programming in JS.

function addToCart(cart, placeOrder){
    function placeOrder(showOrderSummary) {
        function showOrderSummary() {

        }
    }
}

This creates 2 problems.
1.Pyramid of Doom
2.Inversion of control - we lose control of our code.

So Promises were introduced.

promise is an object that states the eventual completion or rejection of an aynchronous operation.

new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if(true){
        resolve("resolved")
    } else {
        const err = new Error("this is how you will create an error");
        reject(err);
    }
}).then(res => {
    console.log("you ll get the response of the previous promise")
})
