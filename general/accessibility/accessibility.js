ARIA lables:

aria-label - "label" - example -> icon inside links,
aria-labelledby - "id",
aria-current,

role,
tabindex,

Use Outline for the components that are focussed.
usually on focussing it will be thin by default.
make sure that the outline will have a minimum thickness.

TabIndex:
first point is that try to avoid tabindex.
tabindex="0" will make focus on the element on clicking tab.
tabindex="-1" will skip the focus on the element.
