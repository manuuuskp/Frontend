What is Redux ?
    Redux is a state management library which can be used for javascript.
It is not only used for React.
Redux has a single store and all the states are maintained in that single store.

Workflow of Redux :
    Redux comprises of three parts.
    1.Store
    2.Reducer
    3.Action

Store - Store has all the states present inside of it.
Reducer - Reducer is the function which will modify the state values in the store.
Action - Dipatching an Action triggers the Reducer function to execute.

Action --dispatched---> triggers Appropriate Reducer Function ----> changes the state in the store ---> reloads component

Link with React :
Redux works outside of the React which means Store will be maintained outside of the react hierarchy.
The Store can then be passed as a prop for Provider Component which provides state across all its children.

npm commands:
    npm i redux
    npm i react-redux

    Advanced release of the Redux is the redux toolkit which eliminates many boiler plate code.

    npm i @reduxjs/toolkit
