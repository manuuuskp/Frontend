What is JSX ?
JSX is a Javascript extension which uses HTML tags to create React Components inside JS.

Purpose of JSX ?
We can create React components using React.createElement(tagname, attrsObj, childElement);
But this will make the maintainability and code readability harder and so React has come up with JSX syntax.
This is much simpler and cleaner than React.createElement.

How does JSX renders in Browser ?
Browsers do not understand JSX.
So JSX needs to transpiled to javascript so that Browser will understand the language.
Inorder to transpile BABEL is used.

How to create JSX equivalent to React.createElement ?
1.First Tags should be opened.
2.Set props as attributes.
3.Pass the child between the tags.

Javascript expression should be wrapped in a curly braces.
