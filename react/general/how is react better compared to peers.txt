How is React better compared to its peers.

Comparing with most popular libraries, Angular and Vue.

Comparing with Angular:
 Angular is a framework and so the size of the bundle is larger when compared with react.
 So React is faster than Angular.

 React uses VirtualDOM when compared with Angular which uses RealDOM and so React's performance
 is comparatively higher compared to Angular.

Comparing with Vue:
 React when compared with Vue has slightly heavier base bundle size.
 but on the other hand React has the largest community and that makes it easier to resolve problems or
 most of the problems have already been resolved.
