React creates a Virtual DOM as manipulating the real DOM directly can be costly.
So whenever there is a change React will create a Virtual DOM and compares it with another Virtual DOM(created earlier).
Now React only updates the changes.
This is the reason why React is fast as it plays with the VirtualDOM instead of Original DOM.

This process of comparing the new Virtual DOM with the old VirtualDOM and then updating the real DOM
is called Reconcillation and React uses a comparison algorithm called Diffing Algorithm.

React Rendering Cycle :
There are two processes in this.
* Rendering and Commiting.

In Rendering it has two types.
1.Initial Render
2.Re-render

React components will be parsed and then JSX elements will be converted to React.createElement.
VirtualDOM will be created and then passed to Commit phase.

So now the comparison happens - Diffing and then React updates the realDOM using ReactDOM library.

The Diffing Algorithm :
1.Element nodes of Different Type.
    React checks if both the element node types are of same or different.
    If same it will check futher. If not it will add to the update list.

2.Element with same type.
    React checks if both the elment node types are same or different.
    If same then it checks for the attribute. if the attributes differ then it will update only that attribute which is changed.

Inaddition React will use the "key" attribute to match the element and update accordingly.
