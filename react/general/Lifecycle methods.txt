Lifecycle methods are important in React as the mounting, updating and unmounting of the component
follows certain method order.

There are three phases in the component lifecycle.

Mounting,
Updating,
UnMounting,

There is a subtle difference in the methods of lifecycle for Class and Functional Components.

Class Component Lifecycle :

Mounting phase :
    1.constructor
    2.getDerivedStateFromProps
    3.render
    4.componentDidMount

Updating phase :
    1.getDerivedStateFromProps
    2.shouldComponentUpdate
    3.render
    4.getSnapshotBeforeUpdate
    5.componentDidUpdate

UnMounting phase :
    1.componentWillUnmount


For Functional Component :

everthing can be achieved using useEffect() Hook

useEffect(() => {

    return () => {

    }
}, []);

useEffect will called initially - componentDidMount.

if something is given in the dependency array and if that value gets modified,
component will rerender - componentDidUpdate.

return function to recreate - componentWillUnmount.
