React follows one way data binding.

What is data binding ??

Data binding is a process of connecting the UI elements with the data that is used to populate the UI elements.

In React one way data binding principle is used.
i.e Data flows from parent element to the child not the other way around.

Inorder to achieve data passing from child to parent, external state management should be used.
or the only other way it to lift the state up.
