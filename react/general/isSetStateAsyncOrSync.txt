is setState synchronous or asynchronous ?

Answer -

Does setState returns any promises ?
NO

Does setState function argument is asynchronous ?
NO

Then the setState is synchronous.
It looks like asynchronous because of the fact that it plays with the 
previous state and that access to previous state is due to the
closures.
setState receives previous state from closures and updates the new state.

setState sets the value to the component's instance and only on the rerender
the component gets updated with the new state.
