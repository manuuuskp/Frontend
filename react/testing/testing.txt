Types of Test:
---------------
Unit Test
Integration Test
E2E test

Unit Test - to test each individual block like each components and each functions and classes.
Integration Test - to test integration between the units.
E2E - to test the whole of the application including real UI, real database, real server.

Filtering a Test
----------------------
test.skip() - skips from getting tested
test.only() - runs only that test.

describe.skip()
describe.only()

Filename conventions
-----------------------
filenames with -
filename.test.js
filename.spec.js

files in __test__ folder

Code Coverage
-------------------------
Code coverage is a metric to test how much of our application is tested.
statement coverage - how many statements were covered.
branches coverage - how many branches like if/else were covered.
function coverage - how many functions that are defined were covered.
line coverage - how many lines of code are covered.

to run coverage - need to configure.

"coverage": "npm test -- --coverage --watchAll --collectCoverageFrom='src/component/**/*.{js,jsx}'"

"jest": {
    "coverageThreshold": {
        "global": {
            "branches" : 80,
            "statements": -10,
            "lines": 80,
            "functions": 80
        }
    }
}

Queries provided by RTL.

getBy - get the element. throws error if the element node is not present.
queryBy - gets the element. returns null if the element node is not preset.
        This way we can check if the element is conditionally rendered.
findBy - returns a promise which will be resolved after 1000ms by default.


there are quite a few methods in all the queries.

getByRole()
getByLabelText()
getByPlaceholderText()
getByDisplayValue()
getByText()
getByAltText()
getByTitle()
getByTestId()

getByText:
------------
TextMatch type.
we can have a function inside getByText() where we can get content and element as arguments.

screen.getByText((content) => content.startsWith("string"))

Manual Queries:
---------------
Manual queries are also possible but querhing by id, class are not possible.
it is highly recommended not to use manual queries.

Debugging:
--------------
screen.debug()
logRoles(view.container) // const view = render(<SomeApp />);


User Events
--------------

Inorder to trigger events we can use fireevent or user-events.
fireEvent is smaller compared to user-events.
fireEvent will only provide a concrete event whereas userevents will provide indepth events.
for example - on text input change -- this happens --> user focuses in text input, types something.
blah blah blah,,, but fireevents only provide the concrete event.

it is better to use user-events.

user.setup()
user.click()
user.type()
user.tab()
user.selectOptions()
user.upload()
user.copy()
user.cut()
user.paste()
user.keyboard()

all user events are asynchronous.
so need to check with async and await.

convenience API, Utility API, Clipboard API.
pointer API, Keyboard API should be looked into for futher events.

Providers:
-------------
render(<COmponent />, {
    wrapper: WrapperComponent
})

Test Custom React Hooks:
---------------------------

will not depend on render or screen methods.
will depend on renderHooks

const {result} = renderHooks(hookname)
expect(result.current.count).toBe(something);

to setInitial props:
const {result} = renderHooks(hookname, {
    initialProps: {
        initialValue: 10
    }
})

import { renderHook } from "@testing-library/react";
import { act } from "react-dom/test-utils";
import { useCounter } from "./useCounter";

describe("useCounter", () => {
  test("initial count", () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(useCounter);
    expect(result.current.count).toBe(0);
  });

  test("initial count through props", () => {
    // initialprops can be set as second argument
    const { result } = renderHook(useCounter, {
      initialProps: 1,
    });
    expect(result.current.count).toBe(1);
  });

  test("increment counter", () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(useCounter);
    //state update should be wrapped in act
    act(() => result.current.increment());
    expect(result.current.count).toBe(1);
  });
});

Mocking a function
--------------------------
Testing a function is like need to check whether that method is called or not.
not to check what that function does.

to do that, we have to create a mock function.
const increment = jest.fn()

await user.click(screen.getByRole("button, {name: "increment}))

expect(increment).toHaveBeenCalled(1);
