hooks are functions which will be used to perform some funtionalities.
hooks were originally introduced to achieve certains things that are in Class Component.
Later with the introduction of custom hooks we can have maintainability and can perform various actions
in functional components.

general rule of thumb is that hook name should start with "use".
hooks can only be used inside functional component.
Even inside the functional component hooks should be used at the top.
