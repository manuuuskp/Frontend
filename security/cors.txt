What is CORS ?

Cross Origin Resource Sharing.

What is that ?

Basically Our Browser will act as a gate keeper and will check with the server in the preflight if the server accepts that particular API
request.
if not browser will not send the request stating that CORS is not enabled.

We can configure in server side.

- access-control-allow-origin
- access-control-allow-methods
- access-control-allow-headers
- access-control-allow-credentials

npm i cors

cors({
    ...options
})

const options = {
    origin: 'https://abc.com',
    methods: ['GET', 'POST']
}

we can byepass CORS issue in FE using chrome extension.
