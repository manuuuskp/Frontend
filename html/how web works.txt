When an user enters the URL and then hits enter - what happens ?
All our webpages are stored somewhere in the server.
Inorder to take the appropriate content out of that server it is to be hit with correct ip address.

so when an user enters the URL and click search, the browser firsts go for the DNS(Domain Name Space) server
and looks for the Domain's IP address. It then requests the server for that IP address.

The server then returns the response.

How HTML is painted ?
As soon as the server returns the response, the HTML forms the render tree.

Normally the HTML is the DOM - Document Object Model and
CSS is the CSSOM - CSS Object Model.

Together they combine and forms the Render Tree.

Then the render tree goes through a layout step where it will decide which components to be placed
in which position of the layout.

then the HTML is rasterized. i.e painted.
