Storage API.

As far as storage API is concerned in the browser we have local storage, session storage, cookie and indexDB.

local Storage :
local storage is one of the storages provided by the storage API of the browser.

the data stored in local storage is persistent. i.e - it will be stored untill it is cleared.
there is no expiration time.
Data stored in the local storage is always of string type. so whenever we get item from local 
storage it should be parsed.

methods in local storage :
localStorage.setItem(key, value);
localStorage.getItem(key);
localStorage.removeItem(key);
localStorage.clear();

session Storage :
session storage is same as local storage but the only difference is that
the data is not persistent.
once the tab is closed then the session values will be cleared automatically.

sessionStorage.setItem(key, value);
sessionStorage.getItem(key);
sessionStorage.removeItem(key);
sessionStorage.clear();

Whenever a new tab is created then the new session will be created.
whenever a tab is duplicated then the session will also be copied.
even if same url is loaded in different tab different sessions will be created for each tab.

Cookies :
Cookies are small text pieces which will be sent by the webserver to the web browsers.
so whenever we visit the same webpage then the webserver makes use of the cookies to
throw advertisement.
to improve their webpage. etc.,

document.cookie="cookiename:value; SameSite:none; Secure";
console.log(document.cookie) will print the cookies.
