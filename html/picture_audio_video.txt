All the three elements - picture, audio and video elements are semantic elements.

<picture></picture>
The picture tag will be used to load images based on different media conditions.
The main purpose is that it makes loading faster. Different type of images can  be loaded for Different
media conditions.

picture tag should have source tag where the mentioned images are given in the srcset attribute.
It will also contain <img> tag for the purpose of fallback.

<picture>
    <source srcset="" media="(min-width:768px)" type="image/jpg"/>
    <source srcset="" media="(min-width:1024px)" type="image/jpeg"/>
    <source srcset="" media="(min-width:1200px)" type="image/avif"/>
    <img src=""/>
</picture>

<video></video>
The Video tag will be used to load video based on different media conditions.

video tag will have "src" attribute or <source> tag where we can mention the different source conditions based on the media.

<video controls height="200px" width="200px" loop src="">
    <source srcset="" media="" type="video/mp4"></source>
    <source srcset="" media="" type="video/webp"></source>
</video>

Video has many attributes.
we can mention height, width.
controls  - boolean attribute which displays the controls in the video.
loop - boolean which plays the video in loop.
autoplay - boolean which starts playing once it is loaded.
preload="auto | meta" - to preload the whole video or only the meta details.

<audio></audio>
This is same as <video> element.
We can also use audio file in video element but is not advisible.

audio has same attributes as that of the <video> element.

<audio src="" controls height="" width="" loop>
    <source srcset="" media="" type=""></source>
</audio>
