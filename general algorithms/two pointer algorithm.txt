Two pointers - as the name indicates, will have two pointers to perform the required task.

It will be better if the Array/String/LinkedList be sorted(O(n logn)).
if it is already sorted then this algorithm can perform in O(n).

It is of two types:
Equi Directional - two pointers, one moves fast and the other moves slow - which also resembles Sliding Window Pattern.
Opposite Directional - two pointers starts from left and right end and moves towards each other.

example - find the sum of two numbers such that it equals k.

this is an opposite directional pointer algorithm.(note: for this sum, arr should be sorted)
